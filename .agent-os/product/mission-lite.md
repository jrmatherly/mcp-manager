# MCP Registry Gateway Mission (Lite)

Enterprise-grade MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry, Gateway, and Proxy System that transforms fragmented MCP server deployments into unified, secure enterprise infrastructure with centralized Azure AD authentication and comprehensive audit capabilities.

**Value Proposition:** Eliminates the complexity of managing multiple MCP servers by providing a single gateway with enterprise-grade security, multi-tenant architecture, and compliance-ready audit logging. Organizations gain centralized control over AI infrastructure while developers get simplified access to MCP resources through unified authentication.

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike basic MCP implementations, built enterprise-first with Azure AD integration, 6-tier role hierarchies, real-time audit logging, and multi-tenant architecture that scales from small teams to large organizations without compromising security or performance.
