# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MCP Server Registration Foundation
> Created: 2025-09-15

## Overview

Implement the foundational MCP server registration and management system that enables enterprise administrators to register, configure, and monitor MCP servers through a secure, authenticated portal. This phase establishes the core infrastructure for server lifecycle management, API key security, and comprehensive audit logging.

## User Stories

### Server Registration Workflow

As an **Administrator**, I want to register new MCP servers, so that authorized users can securely access them through the gateway.

The administrator navigates to the dashboard, clicks "Add Server", and completes a form with server details including name, endpoint URL, description, and configuration. The system validates the server connectivity, generates secure API keys, and adds the server to the registry with appropriate role-based access controls.

### Server Management Interface

As an **Administrator**, I want to view and manage all registered servers, so that I can maintain operational control over the MCP infrastructure.

The dashboard displays server cards showing health status, connection details, and usage metrics. Administrators can enable/disable servers, update configurations, regenerate API keys, and remove servers. All actions are logged for audit compliance.

### API Key Security

As a **Server Owner**, I want to manage API keys with automatic rotation, so that our integration remains secure and compliant.

Users with appropriate permissions can generate API keys with the `mcp_` prefix, view usage statistics, set rotation schedules (90-day default), and revoke compromised keys. The system enforces rate limiting and tracks all key operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **MCP Server Registration APIs** - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on server entities
2. **Enhanced API Key Management** - Secure generation, rotation, and revocation with usage tracking
3. **Server Management Dashboard** - React components for visual server administration
4. **Health Monitoring System** - Real-time connectivity and performance tracking
5. **Audit Logging Infrastructure** - Comprehensive activity logging for compliance
6. **Request/Response Logging** - Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
7. **Basic MCP Proxy Authentication** - Initial authentication framework for server access

## Out of Scope

- OAuth proxy implementation (Phase 2)
- Advanced RBAC with 6-role hierarchy (Phase 3)
- Dynamic Client Registration bridge (Phase 2)
- Prometheus metrics collection (Phase 4)
- Real-time alerting system (Phase 4)
- Advanced analytics dashboards (Phase 4)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional server registration API with full CRUD operations accessible via authenticated endpoints
2. Interactive dashboard interface allowing administrators to visually manage servers, view health status, and control access
3. Secure API key system with automatic rotation, usage tracking, and comprehensive audit trails for compliance
