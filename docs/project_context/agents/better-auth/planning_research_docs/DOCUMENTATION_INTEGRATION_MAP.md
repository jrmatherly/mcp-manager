- Basic authentication flows (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- Session management operations
- User and account management

### Plugin Routes

- Organization management (teams, invitations, RBAC)
- OpenAPI generation and documentation
- Plugin development and configuration

### Security Routes
- Rate limiting configuration
- CSRF protection
- Trusted origins management
- Security headers and policies

### Integration Routes
- Framework-specific implementations
- Social provider configurations
- Client SDK operations
- Database adapter setups

## Recommendations for Future Integration

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **concepts/hooks.mdx** - Essential for plugin development
2. **concepts/api.mdx** - API reference and patterns
3. **concepts/typescript.mdx** - Type safety patterns
4. **plugins/2fa.mdx** - Two-factor authentication
5. **plugins/magic-link.mdx** - Passwordless authentication

### Medium Priority (Common Features)
1. **plugins/jwt.mdx** - JWT token handling
2. **plugins/api-key.mdx** - API key authentication
3. **plugins/passkey.mdx** - WebAuthn support
4. **concepts/email.mdx** - Email configuration
5. **concepts/cookies.mdx** - Cookie management

### Low Priority (Specialized Features)
1. Payment integration plugins
2. Specific provider documentation
3. Migration guides
4. Example implementations

## Integration Patterns Used

### Distribution Strategy
- **Core concepts** → auth-core-specialist
- **Plugin-specific** → Dedicated plugin specialists or auth-plugin-specialist
- **Security features** → auth-security-specialist
- **Database operations** → auth-database-specialist
- **Framework integrations** → auth-integration-specialist
- **Large features** → New dedicated specialists (admin, organization)

### File Size Management
- Target: 1,000-1,500 lines per specialist
- Maximum: 2,000 lines before splitting
- Created new specialists for large domains (admin, organization)
- Distributed large reference files (options.mdx) across relevant specialists

### Cross-Reference Optimization
- Orchestrator handles primary routing
- Specialists reference each other for related features
- Maintained single source of truth for each domain
- Avoided duplication while ensuring comprehensive coverage

## Quality Assurance

### Coverage Verification
- ✅ All requested documentation files integrated
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter on all specialists
- ✅ Orchestrator routing updated for all new patterns
- ✅ File sizes within manageable limits
- ✅ Cross-references properly established

### Knowledge Completeness
- Core authentication flows: Complete
- Plugin system: Complete
- Security features: Complete
- Database operations: Complete
- Framework integrations: Partial (main patterns covered)
- Provider integrations: Partial (main providers covered)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor agent performance** during usage to identify gaps
2. **Prioritize integration** of high-priority documentation as needed
3. **Create specialized agents** for complex plugins (2FA, passkeys, JWT)
4. **Update orchestrator** as new routes are added
5. **Maintain file sizes** through periodic refactoring if needed
