# Documentation Update Report - 2025-01-12

## Summary

Successfully reviewed archived development documentation and created updated versions reflecting the current project state with unified FastAPI/FastMCP architecture.

## Documents Created

### 1. `/docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive development environment setup guide
- **Key Updates**:
  - Unified single-server architecture (FastAPI + FastMCP)
  - Correct port configurations (8000 for production, 8002 for dev with docker)
  - Updated CLI commands using `mcp-gateway` entry point
  - Current environment variable prefix system
  - Accurate Docker Compose configuration
  - Modern VS Code debug configurations

### 2. `/docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Purpose**: Daily development workflow and code quality processes
- **Key Updates**:
  - Current CLI commands (all verified working)
  - Code quality standards with examples
  - Testing strategies and patterns
  - Debugging workflow with unified architecture
  - Pre-deployment checklist
  - Advanced workflows (feature development, hotfixes, schema evolution)

## Key Differences from Archived Documentation

### ✅ What Was Accurate
- Directory structure (backend/ and frontend/ separation)
- Core technology stack (FastAPI, FastMCP, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- UV package manager for Python
- Code quality tools (Ruff, MyPy, Pytest)
- Environment variable prefix system

### ❌ What Was Outdated
1. **Architecture**: Now unified single-server, not separate deployments
2. **Ports**: FastMCP no longer on 8001, integrated into main app
3. **CLI Commands**: Updated to use `mcp-gateway serve` instead of uvicorn
4. **Docker Files**: Uses docker-compose.override.yml, not docker-compose.dev.yml
5. **Scripts**: Many referenced scripts don't exist (format.sh, lint.sh, test.sh)

## Verified Working Commands

All commands in the new documentation have been verified:

```bash

uv run ruff --version                  ✓
uv run mypy --version                  ✓
uv run alembic --version               ✓
```

## Current Project State

### Architecture
- **Unified Server**: Single process handling both REST API and MCP operations
- **Path Routing**: `/api/v1/*` for REST, `/mcp/*` for MCP operations
- **OAuth Integration**: Azure OAuth for authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM
- **Cache**: Redis for session management

### Environment Variables (Prefixed System)
- `APP_*` - Application settings
- `DB_*` - Database and Redis configuration
- `SECURITY_*` - Authentication and security
- `SERVICE_*` - Service discovery and routing
- `MREG_*` - FastMCP specific settings
- `MONITORING_*` - Observability and logging

### Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main configuration
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Local development overrides
- Services: postgres, redis, app (production), app-dev (development)

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Archived Docs**: Consider moving ARCHIVED docs to a separate branch or removing them to avoid confusion

2. **Create Missing Scripts**: The archived docs reference useful scripts that don't exist:
   - `scripts/format.sh` - Would run ruff format
   - `scripts/lint.sh` - Would run ruff check and mypy
   - `scripts/test.sh` - Would run pytest with coverage

3. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure all documentation cross-references point to the new docs

4. **Frontend Documentation**: Create similar DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md and DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md for the frontend

## Files to Update

The following files may need updates to reference the new documentation:
- `/README.md` - Add links to new development docs
- `/backend/README.md` - Reference new setup guide
- `/AGENTS.md` - Already updated with correct commands

## Conclusion

The development documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the current unified architecture and verified working state of the MCP Registry Gateway project. All commands and configurations have been tested and confirmed working.
