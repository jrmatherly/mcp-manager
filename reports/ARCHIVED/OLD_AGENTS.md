## 🏗️ **Unified Architecture Overview**

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP Registry Gateway has successfully transitioned to a **unified single-server architecture**. This is a major architectural change completed in September 2025.

### 🚀 **Architecture Transformation**

**Before (Dual-Server)**:
- FastAPI server on port 8000 (REST API)
- FastMCP server on port 8001 (MCP operations) 
- Two separate processes requiring coordination

**After (Unified)**:
- Single server process on port 8000
- Path-based routing: `/api/v1/*` (REST) and `/mcp/*` (MCP operations)
- 25% memory reduction, 50% fewer database connections
- Single command startup: `uv run mcp-gateway serve --port 8000`

### 🔒 **Key Benefits Achieved**

- **Resource Efficiency**: 25% memory reduction, 50% fewer database connections
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single command startup, unified health monitoring
- **Security Preserved**: Path-based authentication maintains security boundaries
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy endpoints maintained for smooth migration
- **Production Ready**: Zero code quality issues, comprehensive functionality

### 📚 **Documentation References**

- **[Unified Architecture Guide](docs/project_context/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)** - Complete implementation details
- **[Archived Research Reports](reports/archive/README.md)** - Implementation research that led to this architecture

**All AI agents understand this unified architecture and provide guidance accordingly.**

## 🎯 **AI Assistant Guidelines**

### **🤖 Agent-First Development Approach**

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP Registry Gateway uses specialist AI agents for optimal development workflow. Always consider agent delegation for complex tasks.

#### **Agent Selection Strategy**

1. **Single-Domain Tasks**: Route directly to the appropriate specialist agent
   - Authentication issues → **Security Auditor**
   - Performance problems → **Performance Optimizer**
   - Deployment tasks → **Deployment Specialist**
   - FastMCP configuration → **FastMCP Specialist**
   - Protocol compliance → **Protocol Expert**

2. **Multi-Domain Tasks**: Start with **MCP Orchestrator** for coordination
   - Complex debugging spanning multiple components
   - System-wide architecture changes
   - Integration of multiple specialist recommendations

3. **Troubleshooting**: Use **MCP Debugger** as the primary diagnostic agent
   - System health assessment
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Authentication flow analysis
   - Database connectivity issues

#### **Agent Coordination Examples**

```bash
# Example 1: OAuth Integration Issue
1. Security Auditor: "Review Azure OAuth configuration"
2. FastMCP Specialist: "Validate OAuth Proxy implementation"
3. MCP Debugger: "Trace authentication flow" (if needed)

# Example 2: Performance Optimization
1. Performance Optimizer: "Analyze database queries and caching"
2. MCP Debugger: "Identify bottlenecks"
3. FastMCP Specialist: "Optimize structured responses"

# Example 3: Production Deployment
1. Deployment Specialist: "Azure infrastructure setup"
2. Security Auditor: "Production security hardening" 
3. Performance Optimizer: "Production performance tuning"
```

### **When Working on This Project**

1. **Use the unified command format**: `uv run mcp-gateway serve --port 8000` (single server, all features)

2. **Follow the established patterns**:
   - Async/await for all I/O operations  
   - SQLModel for database models  
   - Pydantic settings for configuration  
   - Custom exceptions for error handling

3. **Maintain code quality**:
   - Run `./scripts/format.sh` before committing  
   - Use `./scripts/lint.sh` to check code quality  
   - Add type hints to all public functions  
   - Follow the existing naming conventions

4. **Environment variables**:
   - Always use `MREG_` prefix for new config  
   - Update `.env.example` for new variables  
   - Use appropriate settings class in `core/config.py`

5. **Database operations**:
   - Use SQLModel for new models  
   - Prefer async database operations  
   - Follow the UUID primary key pattern  
   - Add appropriate timestamps

6. **Testing approach**:
   - Update `examples/demo_gateway.py` for new features  
   - Test against running gateway instance  
   - Use the health check endpoint for validation

7. **Documentation**:
   - FastAPI auto-generates API docs from type hints  
   - Update README.md for user-facing changes  
   - Add to `docs/project_context/` for project documentation
   - Add to `claudedocs/` only for AI technical analysis logs

8. **Priority 1 Multi-User Operations (NEW)**:
