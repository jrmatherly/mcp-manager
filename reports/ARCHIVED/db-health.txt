Database Setup Summary
=====================
Date: 2025-09-14

Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL - Database fully operational with all optimizations applied

Actions Performed:
------------------
1. Cleaned up old migration files:
   - Removed: drizzle/20250914164219_moaning_stryfe.sql
   - Removed: drizzle/meta/ directory

2. Generated fresh migration:
   - Created: drizzle/20250914180652_mixed_pet_avengers.sql
   - Includes all 44 tables with proper schema

3. Applied full database setup (npm run db:setup:full):
   ✅ Database 'mcp_registry' exists and connected
   ✅ PostgreSQL version: 17.0 (DBngin.app)
   ✅ Redis connected: version 7.0.0
   ✅ Migrations applied successfully
   ✅ Extensions installed (uuid-ossp, pg_stat_statements, pg_trgm)
   ✅ 10 new performance indexes created
   ✅ 3 database functions installed:
      - calculate_database_health_score()
      - get_active_connections_count()
      - get_slow_queries()
   ✅ 14 views created successfully:
      - v_server_overview
      - v_active_sessions
      - v_api_usage_stats
      - v_tool_performance
      - v_tenant_activity
      - v_security_audit
      - v_rate_limit_status
      - v_system_health_dashboard
      - mv_daily_usage_summary (materialized)
      - mv_server_performance_metrics (materialized)
      - database_size_summary
      - index_usage_summary
      - performance_monitoring
      - performance_alert_status

4. Health Check Results:
   - System health score: 100/100 (healthy)
   - Database connections: 7 total (0 active, 2 idle)
   - All 44 expected tables present
   - All 14 views functioning correctly
   - No unexpected tables found

Key Fixes Applied:
-----------------
1. Fixed SQL function syntax errors (missing semicolons, proper formatting)
2. Corrected view definitions to use proper singular table names
3. Added proper COALESCE() handling for NULL values in calculations
4. Fixed division by zero issues with proper NULLIF() guards
5. Ensured all views handle empty result sets gracefully

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Seed initial data: npm run db:seed (if needed)
2. Start the application: npm run dev
3. Monitor database performance with: npm run db:optimize health-check

Notes:
------
- The database is now in a clean state with all optimizations applied
- All performance indexes are in place but show as "unused" since no data has been processed yet
- The materialized views are empty but will populate as data is added
- Health score of 100/100 indicates all systems are functioning correctly
