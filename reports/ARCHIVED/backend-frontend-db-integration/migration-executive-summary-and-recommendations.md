- **Contingency**: Gradual rollout with ability to disable API key auth if needed

**2. üü° MEDIUM: Database Performance Under Load**
- **Risk**: Shared database performance degrades with dual system load
- **Mitigation**: Redis caching layer, optimized indexes (already implemented)
- **Contingency**: Database connection pooling, query optimization, read replicas

**3. üü° MEDIUM: Redis Dependency Risk**
- **Risk**: Redis failure impacts both API key validation and rate limiting
- **Mitigation**: Redis clustering, graceful degradation, comprehensive monitoring
- **Contingency**: Fallback to database-only validation with performance impact

**4. üü° MEDIUM: API Key Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: API key implementation introduces security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Security audit, penetration testing, secure hashing practices
- **Contingency**: Immediate key revocation capabilities, comprehensive audit logging

**5. üü¢ LOW: FastMCP OAuth Disruption**
- **Risk**: Integration disrupts existing Azure OAuth functionality
- **Mitigation**: Maintain existing OAuth flow unchanged, additive approach only
- **Contingency**: Complete rollback to OAuth-only system if needed

### Testing Requirements
