DATABASE HEALTH CHECK - SUCCESSFUL
=====================================
Date: 2025-09-14

ISSUES FIXED:
1. Missing database function: get_circuit_breaker_status()
   - Fixed by updating function to match actual schema (removed is_active field reference)

2. Missing database function: get_connection_pool_stats()
   - Fixed by updating function to match actual schema (used existing fields)

3. Missing view: performance_alert_status
   - Created view with correct field mappings (trigger_count instead of trigger_count_24h)
   - Added calculated severity field based on threshold values

4. Missing view: database_size_summary
   - Created view to provide database statistics

5. Missing view: index_usage_summary
   - Created view with correct column names (relname/indexrelname)

6. Missing view: performance_monitoring
   - Created view for system performance metrics

SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
- Updated /frontend/drizzle/sql/03_functions.sql to fix function definitions
- Added missing views to /frontend/src/db/setup-views.ts
- All 13 views and 11 database functions now working correctly

FINAL STATUS:
✅ Database health check completed successfully
✅ System health score: 100/100 (healthy)
✅ All required functions operational
✅ All required views created
✅ Database ready for use

Note: The health check reports 287 unused indexes, which is normal for a fresh database
with no data. These indexes will be used once data is added to the system.
